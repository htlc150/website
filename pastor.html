Welcome to the ministry site of Holy Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church of Red Bank.  As you can see, there is much one can do to be involved in the life, work and ministry of the congregation. We embrace the statement "God's work. Our hands." as we strive daily to make our community a better place.  We invite you to 'shine your light' with us as we share and give to our neighbors and our world.
<p>
I am a native of New York and a life-long Lutheran. I was born in Brooklyn and raised on Long Island in the suburban town of North Babylon, New York.  After graduating from High School, I worked in the metal fabrication industry for several years.  I attended Upsala College in East Orange, New Jersey and graduated with a BA in Sociology from Wagner College in Staten Island, New York.  I went on to attend The Lutheran Theological Seminary in Philadelphia (now called United Lutheran Seminary) where I received my Masters of Divinity with a concentration in Urban Studies.  
<p>
I have served congregations in Greensboro and Lexington, North Carolina.  I also served as chaplain at The Lutheran Nursing Home ( now called Trinity Glenn) in Winston Salem, North Carolina.  Prior to coming to Holy Trinity, I served at the English Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Redeemer in Jersey City.  
<p>
Throughout my almost 20 years of ordained ministry, I have had the opportunity to serve on a multitude of church related boards and committees in the North Carolina and New Jersey Synods. I currently serve on ELCA Churchwide level as a second term member of the Board of Trustees of the ELCA Mission Investment Fund.
<p>
In my leisure time, I enjoy a wide host of activities, including spending time with my family, reading, going on nature walks and listening to all kinds of music, in particular, both vocal and instrumental jazz music. 
<p>
I am married to my loving and supportive wife [Cassandra] for over 25 years and together we have two college-aged daughters [Alexandra and Josefina].
