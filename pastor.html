Hi! How are you?!
<p>
I'm so glad you've found this church and are looking over its webpage.  
Let me tell you a little bit about Holy Trinity Lutheran Church and a little 
bit about me (people always seem to want to know about the pastor).
<p>
I remember standing in the pulpit (the place where the readings and sermons 
are shared) when I was meeting members of the congregation to discern if 
there was a call between us (i.e., figuring out if there was a fit between 
'me' as pastor and 'them' as congregation).  As I stood in the pulpit, and 
by the altar, I thought about the job that I had loved, was successful at 
and left... about the five years I spent studying at two seminaries: Princeton 
Theological Seminary where I earned an M.Div. and 
Lutheran Theological Seminary in Philadelphia where I earned a second master, 
STM. I thought about the summer I spent being a chaplain in a hospital and 
hospice program through which I was awarded a credit for Clinical Pastoral 
Education (affectionately known as 'CPE')... about the two years I served as 
an intern at a large Lutheran Congregation in New Jersey... about the church 
I grew up in and the interviews and screenings all candidates within the 
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America are required to undergo... all the 
incredible people who had witnessed sacrifice, love, compassion, 
understanding, hard work, faith, endurance, humor, forgiveness 
(not least of which, my parents).  And then I thought, <i>'...this is all the 
	church I have dreamed being a part of!' </i> When and if you come 
here, I trust you will feel the same.
<p>
Holy Trinity is a beautiful church and congregation. Not ostentatious.
In many ways understated. That is true of the church physically, and,
it is true of the people, mission and ministry shared here.
<p>
Not only is the sanctuary beautiful, the fellowship hall neat/efficient
and the location convenient, the worship life of the congregation is
marvelous.  By 'worship life' I mean not only our Sunday morning gatherings
or Wednesday Night Evening Prayer services.  I mean how people here live
out their baptism.  This church does this in so many ways:  from liturgical
worship that is lively, contemporary, informal, inclusive of children to
potluck meals, game nights, July 3rd Hot Dog give-away (HT has a great
location for catching Red Bank's fireworks), annual theme based suppers
(this year it was 'Nordic Nights'); from 1st Communion Instruction,
children's education, adult learning opportunities, confirmation instruction
to garage sales, property days and 'beginning of the church year' rally
days; from emergency offerings collected that are shared throughout the world
to food items collected and distributed locally; from...to...it goes on and on.
In other words, it seems to me that Holy Trinity is a place where we all
grow in faith that grounds, heals and inspires us to be healing agents
within, to and among God's creation.
<p>
So -in the words of one of the gospel writers- 'Come and see!'  And when
you do, I hope you discover Holy Trinity to be all the church you have
been looking for as well.
<p>
God's grace and peace be with you,
<p>
Pastor Dean (or just plain 'Dean')
